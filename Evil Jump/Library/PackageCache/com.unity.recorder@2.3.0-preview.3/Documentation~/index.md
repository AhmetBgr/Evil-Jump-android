# About Unity Recorder

![Unity Recorder](Images/RecorderSplash.png)

Use the Unity Recorder package to capture and save data during [Play mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html). For example, you can capture gameplay or a cinematic and save it as a video file.

>[!NOTE]
>You can only use the Recorder in the Unity Editor. It does not work in standalone Unity Players or builds.

## Recording

You can set up and launch recordings in two ways:

- From the [Recorder window](RecordingRecorderWindow.md).

- Through a [Recorder Clip](RecordingTimelineTrack.md) within a [Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.timeline@latest) track.

## Available recorder types

### Default recorders

The Unity Recorder includes the following recorder types by default:

* **Animation Clip Recorder:** generates an animation clip in Unity Animation format (.anim extension).

* **Movie Recorder:** generates a video in MP4, WebM or MOV format.

* **Image Sequence Recorder:** generates a sequence of image files in JPEG, PNG, or EXR (OpenEXR) format.

* **GIF Animation Recorder:** generates an animated GIF file.

* **Audio Recorder:** generates an audio clip in WAV format.

### Additional recorders

You can also benefit from additional Recorder types if you install specific packages along with the Unity Recorder:

* The [Alembic for Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.formats.alembic@latest) package includes an **Alembic Clip Recorder**, which allows you to record and export GameObjects to an Alembic file.

* The [FBX Exporter](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.formats.fbx@latest) package includes an **FBX Recorder**, which allows you to record and export animations directly to FBX files.

* The **Unity AOV Recorder** allows you to capture specific render pass data (related with material, geometry, depth, motion, lighting...) in projects that use Unity's [HDRP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest) (High Definition Render Pipeline).

### Legacy recorders

As of version 1.0, Unity Recorder uses recorders types that take better advantage of Unity Editor features and are more stable than previous versions. If you're upgrading from a pre-1.0 version of Unity Recorder, or supporting legacy content, you can toggle the legacy recorder types on from Unity's main menu: **Window > General > Recorder > Options > Show Legacy Recorders**.
