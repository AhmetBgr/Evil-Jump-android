# Audio Recorder properties

The **Audio Recorder** generates an audio clip in WAV format.

This page covers all properties specific to the Audio Recorder type.

> **Note:** To fully configure any Recorder, you must also set the global [Recording Properties](Recording.md) for the capture (properties shared with the other recorders, such as the frames to record).
