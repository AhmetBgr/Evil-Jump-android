## About the project

This is the first ever game I made in unity. I wanted to do a game which is similar to already existing game with simple design and I wanted to implement new systems to that design to learn unity's basics, C# and basic elements of game design. The new mechanichs I implemented to the game were followings;
- Dash mechanic to destroy enemies and quickly move one platform to another,
- Active and passive power ups,
- A shop to buy and upgrade power ups.

Here is the gameplay;
